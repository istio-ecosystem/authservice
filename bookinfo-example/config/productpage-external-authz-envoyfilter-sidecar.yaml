#
# Add the ext_authz filter to the productpage app's sidecar's Envoy filter chain.
# Configure the ext_authz filter to ask the authservice about every incoming request
# via GRPC. For every incoming request, the authservice will decide to either allow
# the request and add tokens as headers, or will cause the response to redirect for
# authentication.
