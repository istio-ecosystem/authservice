# Developer documentation

Authservice (main binary name: `auth_server`) is built using Bazel build system. Every submitted
commit is checked (by running tests and build jobs) by our CI on GitHub Actions.

Currently, we only support macOS and Linux as development platform.

We run [`bazel`](https://bazel.build/) through [`bazelisk`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk)
to make sure we use the correct version of `bazel`. Due to some limitation in current dependencies,
we need to request `bazel` dist as "amd64" arch exclusively for both macOS and Linux: for that we
require to run [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) through `go run` with `GOARCH`
environment variable set to `amd64`. Thus, we require [Go 1.17.x](https://go.dev/doc/install) or
later to build this project.

Please invoke `make help` (or you can also inspecting the main [`Makefile`](./Makefile)) for
available targets.

To build authservice with `clang`, firstly, you need to setup the `clang.bazelrc`. This can be
accomplished by:

```console
make clang.bazelrc
BAZEL_FLAGS="--config clang" make build
```

To Build with FIPS compliant version, add `--define boringssl=fips`.

```console
make clang.bazelrc
BAZEL_FLAGS="--config clang --define boringssl=fips" make build
```
