# Example Istiod values.yaml that configures the Authservice as an extension provider
meshConfig:
  extensionProviders:
    # Configure the backend for the Auth Service provider that can be used in AuthorizationPolicies
    # in CUSTOM mode.
    - name: authservice-grpc
      envoyExtAuthzGrpc:
        # This must match the Kubernetes service and port where the authservice is listening.
        service: "authservice.authservice.svc.cluster.local"
        port: "10003"   # This port is the one to be set in the authservice config
