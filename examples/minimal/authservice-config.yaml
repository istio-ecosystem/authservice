                  The `callback_url` must point to the application that is guarded behind the OIDC login.,
                  The path can be "anything", as long as it is configured in the ingress Gateway or VirtualService,
                  to be forwarded to the application (even when the application does not expose such path). The,
                  Istio AuthorizationPolicy that intercepts traffic will intercept the calls to this path and forward,
                  them appropriately to the authservice.
